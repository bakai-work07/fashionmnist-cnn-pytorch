# ðŸŸ  Convolutional Neural Network Classification on FashionMNIST (PyTorch)
This is my implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying grayscale images from the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch. It closely follows the workflow taught in "PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course" by Daniel Bourke, adapted from earlier exercises like make_blobs to work with real image data.

## The main purpose of this mini-project is to practice and understand:

- Building CNN architectures from scratch in PyTorch
- Managing model training and evaluation on image data
- Using device-agnostic code (CPU vs CUDA)
- Saving and loading model weights
- Making predictions and visualizing model performance on unseen data

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced

- Loading and preparing FashionMNIST using torchvision.datasets
- Building a multi-layer CNN using nn.Conv2d, nn.ReLU, and nn.MaxPool2d
- Writing a custom training loop with loss tracking and accuracy computation
- Understanding underfitting and testing different optimizers (e.g. SGD vs Adam)
- Saving model weights using torch.save() and reloading with torch.load()
- Writing a reusable make_predictions() function for inference
- Visualizing predictions using matplotlib in a 3x3 grid with colored labels
